# CHDForge - Batch CHD Converter

A macOS app for batch converting disc images to CHD format using [chdman](https://wiki.recalbox.com/en/tutorials/utilities/rom-conversion/chdman).

## About

This project was vibe coded with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (Anthropic's AI assistant) based on a script I originally wrote. The entire SwiftUI app — architecture, UI, parsing, and batch processing — was built collaboratively through conversation with Claude.

## Features

- Batch convert CUE/BIN, GDI, and ISO disc images to CHD
- Folder scanning with recursive file discovery
- Drag and drop folder support
- Parallel conversions with configurable concurrency
- Pause, resume, and cancel conversions
- Real-time progress tracking with ETA
- Per-job and global logging with log file export
- Optional source file deletion after successful conversion
- macOS notifications on batch completion
- Auto-detection of chdman with guided install (Homebrew or MAME download)
- Automatic chdman capability detection (createcd/createdvd)
- Configurable chdman binary path
- macOS native SwiftUI interface
